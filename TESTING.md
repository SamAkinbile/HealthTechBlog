- Within the product detail page there is a quantity selector and an Add to Bag button. Shoppers can adjust the quantity by using the buttons located on either side of the input, or by typing in the amount.
- When the user clicks on the add to bag button, the chosen quantity of the product is added to the user's shopping bag.
